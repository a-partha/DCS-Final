          <p>Referring to American academic N.G. Barrier’s study of banned literature and publications, author Devika Sethi notes that 8,000-10,000 individual titles were proscribed, and 2,000 newspapers were subjected to legal restraint during the last 40 years of colonial rule.</p>
          <p>During India’s independence movement, various forms of underground media were utilized to spread information, pamphlets, and rally resistance against the British. These channels constituted a part of the undercommons, circumventing censorship and surveillance.</p>
          <p>One of them was Congress Radio, started by Usha Mehta, who was a 22-year-old political science student at Wilson College in Bombay (now Mumbai). One of the many often overlooked participants of the freedom movement, she played a crucial role in establishing the underground radio station that amplified Mahatma Gandhi’s message of rebellion. After Gandhi's call for the start of a mass civil disobedience movement, the Quit India campaign, both he and supporting Congress leaders were quickly arrested by the British.</p>
          <p>With the help of other activists, Mehta acquired a ghost transmitter and launched an underground radio station, broadcasting live on Aug 14, 1942. A ghost transmitter is an illegal transmitter that operates on a frequency without proper licensing or authorization. They can cause interference with legitimate radio communications. </p>
          <p>Her station relayed news, patriotic speeches, and appeals aimed at the people she referred to as “workers in the struggle” — students, lawyers, and police officers. Mehta stated, "When the newspapers dared not touch upon these subjects under the prevailing conditions, it was only the Congress Radio which could defy the orders and tell the people what actually was happening". They reported various news items, from merchants refusing to export rice to the arrests of leaders and civilians. She mentioned receiving news from all over India via special messengers and even from the All India Congress Committee in Bombay.</p>
          <p>After the nation’s official All India Radio — which other activists labeled as “Anti-India Radio” — began jamming their broadcasts, Mehta and her team tried to fight back. They were frequently pursued by a police van, forcing them to relocate multiple times to hide their whereabouts. She mentioned changing locations six to seven times during their operations. To avoid further risk, they had a separate recording station from the broadcast one and, for a period, aired messages across two transmitters.</p>
          <p>However, their fortune ran out on Nov 12, 1942, when they were caught after a technician betrayed them by revealing their location. As more than 50 police officers breached their three bolted doors, Mehta instructed everyone to leave while she continued broadcasting until the door was broken down. "We played 'Hindustan Hamara' (a Hindi patriotic song). Then we relayed some news bulletins and a speech. Just when we were at the end of the program, playing 'Vande Mataram' (a Bengali patriotic song), we heard hard knocks on the door".</p>
          <p>They seized the equipment and 22 cases containing photos and sound films from the Congress party sessions. Following a prolonged investigation, solitary confinement, and a five-week trial, Mehta was jailed until March 1946. Reflecting on her contribution to the nation's freedom struggle after her release, she said, "Do or die". In 1998, she received the Padma Vibhushan, one of India’s highest civilian honors.</p>
