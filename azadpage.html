            <p>Azad Hind Radio was a radio service started under the leadership of Indian Nationalist Subhash Chandra Bose in 1942 in Nazi Germany to encourage Indians to fight against the British. It crossed geographical boundaries and became a source of inspiration for millions across India and southeast Asia.</p>
            <p>Initially funded by the Germans in a controversial alliance, the shortwave station started out focusing on driving anti-allied force messages and messages seeking Indian independence. Bose saw it as an opportunity to reach out to Indian soldiers serving in the British Army and reignite their sense of freedom. The station’s strong broadcasts, delivered in many Indian languages struck a chord with these soldiers, encouraging them to defect and fight for a free India. Bose had initially wanted to launch two additional radio stations, one called 'Congress Radio' that would be aimed at the supporters of Gandhi and another called 'Azad Muslim Radio' to counter the actions of the Muslim League. He wanted to keep the stations secret at first to give the impression that its content was being broadcast from somewhere in India.</p>
            <p>The station's headquarters shifted to Rangoon in Myanmar and later to Singapore following the war in South-east Asia. This move broadened its reach and allowed Bose to communicate directly with the Indian National Army, his armed force fighting alongside the Japanese against the British. </p>
            <p>But the radio’s affiliation with the Axis Powers was questionable. While some believe Bose’s decision was pragmatic and motivated by a need for financial support, others condemn his collaboration with authoritarian regimes. The programming on the station was largely considered Nazi German propaganda against the British actions in the region. The BBC launched its own Eastern Service station in the early 1940s to counter such stations.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, Bose’s passionate speeches and renowned slogans delivered with his trademark fervor, energized his audience and became rallying points for the freedom movement. The station continued operations until June 1945 even after Bose's Indian National Army was defeated by the British in 1944.</p>
