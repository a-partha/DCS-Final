            <p>The Salt march, also known as the Salt Satyagraha (a force coming from an angle of truth and love) or Dandi March was an act of nonviolent civil disobedience in colonial India, led by Mahatma Gandhi from 12 March 1930 to 6 April 1930. The march was the first act of a larger campaign of civil disobedience against the British rule</p>
            <p>Salt production and distribution in India had long been a lucrative monopoly of the British. Through a series of laws (The 1882 Salt Act), the Indian populace was not allowed to produce or sell salt on its own, and instead Indians were required to buy expensive, heavily taxed salt that often was imported. This affected the great majority of Indians, who were poor and could not afford to buy it. The salt tax represented 8.2% of the British Raj tax revenue, and hurt the poorest Indians the most significantly.</p>
            <p>After issuing the Declaration of Sovereignty and Self-rule, or Purna Swaraj, on 26 January 1930, the Indian National Congress gave Gandhi the responsibility for organizing the first act of civil disobedience. He chose salt as his undercommons medium. The Statesman, a prominent newspaper at the time, wrote "It is difficult not to laugh, and we imagine that will be the mood of most thinking Indians” about his choice. The British colonial administration too was not disturbed by these plans of resistance against the salt tax. The Viceroy - Lord Irwin, did not take the threat of a salt protest seriously, writing to London, "At present, the prospect of a salt campaign does not keep me awake at night."</p>
            <p>However, Gandhi had his reasons. He felt that item of daily use could resonate more with citizens of all classes than an abstract demand for greater political rights. He also felt that this protest would dramatize 'Purna Swaraj' in a way that was meaningful to every Indian, reasoning that it would build unity between Hindus and Muslims by fighting a wrong that touched them equally.</p>
            <p>On 12 March 1930, Gandhi and 78 satyagrahis, among whom were men from various backgrounds in India, set out on foot from his ashram (religious retreat) at Sabarmati (near Ahmadabad) for the coastal village of Dandi, 385 km (about 240 miles) away in Navsari district of Gujarat. After each day’s march the group stopped in a different village along the route, where increasingly larger crowds would gather to hear Gandhi rail against the unfairness of the tax on poor people. Hundreds more would join the core group of followers as they made their way to the sea until on April 5 the entourage reached Dandi where more than 50,000 people were gathered. On the morning of April 6, Gandhi raised a lump of salty mud and declared, "With this, I am shaking the foundations of the British Empire”. He then boiled it in seawater, thus technically producing illegal salt. </p>
            <p>No arrests were made that day, and Gandhi continued his satyagraha against the salt tax for the next two months, exhorting other Indians to break the salt laws by committing acts of civil disobedience. Mass civil disobedience spread throughout India as millions broke the salt laws by making salt or buying illegal salt. In reaction, the British government arrested over sixty thousand people by the end of the month. What had begun as a Salt Satyagraha quickly grew into a mass Satyagraha. British cloth and goods were boycotted. Unpopular forest laws were defied in the Bombay, Mysore and Central Provinces. Gujarati peasants refused to pay tax, under threat of losing their crops and land.</p>
            <p>The British responded with more laws, including censorship of correspondence and declaring the Congress and its associate organizations illegal. None of those measures slowed the civil disobedience movement. A truce subsequently was declared, which was formalized in the Gandhi-Irwin Pact that was signed on March 5. It paved the way for Gandhi, representing the Indian National Congress, to attend the second session (September–December 1931) of the Round Table Conference (discussions for an autonomous India) in London. The Salt Satyagraha did not produce immediate progress toward dominion status or self-rule for India but it was helpful in the long-run. It also had a strong influence on American civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr., and his fight for civil rights in the 1960s.</p>
